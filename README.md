 Cognitive Modeling — Basic Intro Notes

## Cognitive Modeling (Definition)
Cognitive modeling is the use of mathematical and computational models to formally describe mental processes.

### Why It's Important
- Translates cognitive theories into formal models
- Links cognitive processes to data
- Supports prediction and explanation

---

## Computational Thinking (Definition)
Computational thinking is expressing ideas clearly so that they can be implemented and executed by a computer.

- Uses programming languages and mathematical models to create precision
- Uses simulation as an epistemic tool to instantiate models dynamically

## Types of Models

### Mathematical Models
Formal models defined by equations and probability structure.

- Statistical models
- Bayesian models
- Analytical cognitive models

### Computational Models
Algorithmic models implemented in code.

- Simulation models
- Neural network models
- Agent-based models
